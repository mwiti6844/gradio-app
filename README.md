## Summarization Gradio App
This project is a simple text summarization app built with Gradio to test its capabilities for creating interactive machine learning interfaces. The app uses the facebook/bart-large-cnn model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to generate concise summaries of longer texts.

### About This Project
The main focus of this project is to explore and test Gradio's functionalities, including real-time updates, user-friendly interfaces, and easy deployment of machine learning models. I plan to experiment more with Gradio to understand its limits and potential use cases for future projects.

### Features
Text Summarization: Input long texts and get concise summaries using a state-of-the-art transformer model.
Real-Time Output: The app displays the summarized text in real-time as it is being generated.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface with examples to get started quickly.
Future Plans
Test more complex Gradio features, such as multiple inputs and outputs, audio processing, and more.
Explore Gradio's potential for deploying other types of machine learning models and tasks.
Enhance the app's UI/UX to make it more interactive and visually appealing.
